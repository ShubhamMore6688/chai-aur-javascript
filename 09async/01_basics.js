// javascript - synchronous and single threaded language
// synchronous - each operation wait for the last one to complete before executing
// execute one line of code at a time

// blocking code vs non blocking code
// blocking code - block the flow of the program (read file sync)
// nonblocking code - does not block the executition (read file async)




// when function in the call stack call the async function (settimeout) this is stored in the register call back
// task queue is maintain for such fucntion because we need to add them again in the stack
